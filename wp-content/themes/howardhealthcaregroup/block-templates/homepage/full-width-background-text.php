                                    <p>Many billing and collections companies focus on volume.  The more claims processed the more money is made by the billing operation even if the provider is being paid only a fraction of the billed charges. In addition, practices often allocate time and resources to pursue collections from patients for outstanding balances not paid by the payors. Our approach is vastly different than any typical billing and/or collections company. We focus on pursuing fair payment from the payors rather than patients by offering a sophisticated billing service that sets up your claims management cycle to optimize payment from the start.</p>
                                    <p>Providers are measured on many factors with patient satisfaction being paramount to a practiceâ€™s livelihood. Providers get into medicine to care for patients and end up being confronted with a multitude of administrative burdens that can adversely impact patient relations all in the pursuit of attempting to get fairly paid for services rendered.  We are committed to helping providers get back to what they do best, practicing medicine.</p>
